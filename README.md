~~The library behind making those magical Quest videos that look like PC~~

# The story behind this
This library has been in the works for many months with the help of many developers. A lot of effort has been put into making this stable and properly usable, but it is still not very friendly or generic yet. 
It currently is not very configurable or well documented, but it's a start.

The idea behind this project came up when we jokingly said we would make a mod that would record videos better than ~~Oculus'~~ Meta's own recording software (which is horrible) which looks and sounds like a video recorded on a phone. (I guess that's what happens when you use a mobile chip)
Throughout the many months of researching, development and testing we are finally able to show the horrifying code behind it all.

## How to use
Err, we don't really know yet. 

## How to compile
- Clone repository
- run `qpm-rust restore`
- Run `python3 ./update_ffmpeg.py`
- `./build.ps1`
- Profit
